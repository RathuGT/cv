      I'm Rumeth Rathubalage.
      Simply call me Rumeth. The founder of the world's most trusted software development company <em>SolitaryX</em>.
      I've been coding since 15. Coding has been my hobby for the past 15 years.While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a programmer.
      I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with programming, but over the years, my passion for coding has increased.
       Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy.
